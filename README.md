# Memory Game

Memory game in which you have to find all the pairs by turning max 2 cards at a time.  
It requires observation, concentration and a good memory to win.

# How to play

* Turn pair of cards and try to match them
* Try remembering where cards position is so that you can match them next turn
* The game end when all the cards are matched and faced up
Good luck!

## TODO
Add input to select the number of pairs you want the game to have (A.K.A "difficulty") 
Fix mobile/tablet issues. 
Maybe add a scoreboard on localhost for local gameplay (hopefully have a live version if the game will ever run on a server)
